# ImageClassifierUsingTensorFlow.js

This is a simple image classifier using TensorFlow.js. It accesses the feed through the webcam and you can save various objects/gestures into classes so that you can classify them later. Each time you click one of the "Add" buttons, one image is added to that class as a training example. While you do this, the model continues to make predictions on webcam images coming in and shows the results in real-time.

This image classifier was created by following the [Google TensorFlow.js Image Classifier Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification) and added some bootstrap to make the app responsive.
